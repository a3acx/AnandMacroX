## What is this?
This project is esentially a MacroPad designed with 12 Cherry MX Switches (3 rows and 4 columns) with 4 EC11 Rotary Encoders located under the the switches. This MacroPad also includes an 128x64 OLED display which could be used to display anything from the time and date to performnace statistics of your computer.

## Why did I make this?
When I was playing a video game, I realized that it would be nice if i had some shortcuts to perform certain actions faster. I looked around on the internet and found many suitable options. However, there was a major issue. All of the options that I considered were over $200! That is when I decided that I would try to make my own. And what you see here is that result.

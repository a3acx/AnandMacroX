## July 10th, 2025
Today, i worked on placing everything on the PCB side of things. The snap grid was malfunctioning :( but after I updated Kicad to Version 9.0, it got much better! I also routed the PCB and spent 4 hours working on this.

Today, I redesigned my PCB multiple times to try to get it down to 100mmx100mm. I did this successfully. I also worked on the bottom portion of the case for my MacroPad. This took a total of 4 hours.
